##Description


A palindrome is a string of characters that are read the same way both ways (forward and backwards). Given two range of integers (a_start, a_end and b_start, b_end), if at least one of the products between the two ranges is a palindrome, print the integer-pair.
For example, if the first range of integers is [90,99] and the second is [90,99], there is at least one palindrome because 91 x 99 = 9009, which is read the same forward and backward. Thus, "91, 99" should br printed.

Formal Inputs & Outputs:

Input Description:
Integer a_start - The starting range of the integer a
Integer a_end - The ending range of the integer a
Integer b_start - The starting range of the integer b
Integer b_end - The ending range of the integer b

Output Description:
Print an integer pair if their product is a palindrome.

Sample Inputs & Outputs:
Let a_start and a_end be 10, 11, and let b_start and b_end be 10, 11. Your code, given these arguments, should print "11, 11", since 11 * 11 is 121, and is a palindrome.


##Solution


def is_palindrome(number):

    if number[:] == number[::-1]:
        return True

def palindromic_product(a_start,a_end,b_start,b_end):
    for x in range(a_start,a_end):
        for y in range(b_start,b_end):
            number = str(x*y)
            if is_palindrome(number):
                print('X:',x,'Y:',y,'Product:',number)
